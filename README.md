# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview
In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
In the first part  i explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, i applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
Then evaluating several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, i optimized the model i've selected and present it as my solution to CharityML. 
Finally, i explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given. predicted selling price to my statistics.


## What I learnt?
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.


## Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


## Project files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: The main file where project has been performed.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes.
- `report.html`: A HTML file cantaining a copy of 'finding_donors.ipynb'

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

## Built With

 - [iPython]([https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/)) - This is the file conaining all the python codes. We can make separate blocks of iPython for performing separate tasks. File extension is `.ipynb`
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) - [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. With over 11 million users worldwide, it is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.
